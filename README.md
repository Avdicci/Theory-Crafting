Random ahh damage calculations and stuff like that for a game that doesn't exist anywhere but my mind

If you want to join in on the fun, here's how:

1. Go into "Issues" on Github, pick one you want to work on.

2. On the right panel under "Development", create a branch and call it "(your name)/(issue number): your fix message(lowercase)", example: "Avdicci/004: add description"

3. When finished with your coding, create a pull request by using "gh pr create" in the terminal and submit. If this does not work, do it any other way you know.

4. BONUS! If it's your first time contributing, add your name in "contributors.md" following the alphabetical order and format of the other contributors
